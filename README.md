# RESTAURANT-ANALYSIS

This project analyzes customer feedback for a restaurant, using advanced sentiment analysis and machine learning to uncover trends in customer satisfaction. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze and categorize feedback into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment, providing insights into areas of improvement and strengths.

Key Objectives:
Sentiment Analysis: Leverage both VADER and TextBlob sentiment analysis tools to derive polarity scores from customer feedback, enabling a dual-layered approach for higher accuracy.
Text Feature Engineering: Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical representations, identifying words that significantly impact customer sentiment.
Classification Model: Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict sentiment categories from textual feedback, using supervised machine learning to automate sentiment categorization.
Visualization and Insights: Generate visualizations such as sentiment distribution, confusion matrix, and feature importance plots, helping stakeholders understand key drivers of customer sentiment.
Tools and Technologies:
Libraries: Pandas for data processing, TextBlob and VADER for sentiment analysis, TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction, RandomForestClassifier for machine learning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Google Drive Integration: Allows easy access to data stored in Drive, supporting seamless integration for Google Colab users.
Benefits:
The project offers valuable insights into customer experiences, identifying positive feedback trends and highlighting potential issues. By leveraging machine learning to automate sentiment classification, it equips restaurant management with actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and retention.
